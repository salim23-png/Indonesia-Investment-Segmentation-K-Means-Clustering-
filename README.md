# Indonesia Investment Segmentation: K-Means Clusteringüé°

## Overviewüîç
Indonesia is one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia, and investment plays a vital role in its development. The dataset used here comes from Kaggle titled "Indonesia Investment Realization (BKPM Official)." This dataset provides a comprehensive view of 15 years of investment realization (2010‚Äì2025) based on official BKPM (Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board) records. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshefingani/and-x1f1ee-and-x1f1e9-indonesia-investment-2010-2025/data).
